The main event:
- Set up your project like a professional
- Learn to work effectively with AI
- Build your application piece by piece

### Part 3: Shipping (Phases 8-9)
Get it out there:

## Tips for Success

::: tip Stay Curious
Ask "why?" often. Understanding the reasoning helps more than memorizing steps.
:::

::: tip Make Mistakes
Errors are learning opportunities. Every developer sees error messages constantly.
:::

::: tip Use the Reference
The reference section has cheatsheets. Print them if it helps!
:::

::: tip Take Breaks
The breaks are scheduled for a reason. Step away, stretch, hydrate.
