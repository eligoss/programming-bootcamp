# Business Requirements

> **Time**: ~5 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

## What You'll Learn

- How to define the problem and users
- Choosing your feature

## The Four Questions

### 1. What Problem Are We Solving?

**Template:** "I need a private place to store and organize my [notes/tasks/bookmarks] that only I can access."

The problem should be:
- **Real** — Someone actually has this problem
- **Specific** — Not "make life better"
- **Solvable** — We can build a solution

### 2. Who Is The User?

For this bootcamp: **You** (single user)

**Characteristics:**
- Wants a simple tool
- Needs private access (authentication)
- Uses it on a computer (web browser)

### 3. What Value Does It Provide?

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Private storage** | Only you see your data |
| **Always available** | Access from any device |
| **Organized** | Better than scattered notes |
| **Secure** | Protected by authentication |

### 4. What Are The Constraints?

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| **4-5 hours** | Keep it simple, no fancy features |
| **Beginner skill** | Use established patterns |
| **Single user** | No complex permissions |
| **Learning focus** | Understandable code over clever code |

## Choose Your Feature

| Option | Description | Good For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Personal Notes** | Title + content | Simple, fast to build |
| **Task Tracker** | Name + checkbox | More interactive |
| **Bookmark Saver** | URL + title + description | Actually useful |

All share: user registration, login, protected routes, user-scoped data.

**Your choice:** ________________

## What's OUT of Scope

- ❌ Multiple user roles (admin, user, etc.)
- ❌ Social login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Password reset via email
- ❌ Fancy animations

These are good features — for *later*.
