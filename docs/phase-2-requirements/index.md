# Phase 2: Requirements

> **Time**: ~30 minutes | **Goal**: Define exactly what we're building

## Why This Phase?

The biggest mistake in software: jumping straight to code. Professional developers spend time understanding *what* they're building before *how* to build it.

## What You'll Cover

- Why requirements come first
- Business requirements (the problem and users)
- Functional requirements (user stories)
- Technical requirements (technology decisions)
- Non-functional requirements (quality attributes)

## By the End

You'll have:
- A clear problem statement
- User stories for your features
- Acceptance criteria you can test against
- Technical decisions documented
