# Phase 3: Work Breakdown

> **Time**: ~15 minutes | **Goal**: Turn requirements into actionable tasks

## What This Phase Is About

Now that you know *what* to build, you need to figure out *how* to approach it. Big projects are overwhelming. Small tasks are doable.

This phase teaches you to break things down into pieces you can actually complete.

## What You'll Learn

- **From big to small** — Epics → Stories → Tasks
- **What makes a good task** — Small, testable, clear
- **Your first backlog** — An ordered list of work

## The Key Insight

> A task should be small enough to complete in one focused session, and clear enough that you know when it's done.

"Build the login page" is too big.
"Add email input field to login form" is just right.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Understanding of work breakdown structure
- [ ] A backlog of tasks for your project
- [ ] Confidence about where to start
