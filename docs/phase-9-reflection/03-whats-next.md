# What's Next

> **Time**: ~5 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

## What You'll Learn

- Where to go from here
- Resources for continued learning
- Suggested next projects

## The Big Idea

This bootcamp was a foundation, not a ceiling. Here's how to keep building.

## Immediate Next Steps

### Today/Tomorrow

1. **Share your work**
   - Post your project URL on social media
   - Update LinkedIn with your new skills
   - Tell someone what you built (family, friends, online community)
   - Add project to your resume

2. **Review the code**
   - Read through what was generated line by line
   - Make sure you understand each part
   - Add comments where helpful
   - Look up concepts you're fuzzy on

3. **Make one small addition**
   - Add a "Delete Account" button
   - Change the color scheme
   - Add validation to a form field
   - Add a footer with your name
   - Just to prove you can edit the code yourself

### This Week

1. **Practice the workflow**
   - Build something small from scratch
   - Follow the same Plan → Implement → Verify → Commit loop
   - Don't use this guide—try on your own
   - Get stuck, debug, succeed

2. **Explore the codebase**
   - What happens if you change X?
   - Can you add a new route?
   - Try breaking things (on a branch!)
   - Use `git checkout -b experiment` to safely experiment

3. **Write about it**
   - Blog post about your experience
   - LinkedIn post announcing your project
   - Dev.to article with lessons learned
   - Teaching others solidifies your own learning

**Timeline:** Most self-taught devs are job-ready in 6-12 months of consistent work (10+ hours/week).

## The Developer Mindset

As you continue, internalize these principles:

### Stay Curious
> "How does this work?" is the best question.

- Read source code of libraries you use
- When something seems like magic, dig deeper
- Follow the "why" behind best practices
- Question assumptions (including your own)

**Example:** Don't just use useState—read [how it works](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/react/src/ReactHooks.js).

### Embrace Confusion
> Confusion precedes understanding. Every time.

- Being confused means you're learning
- If it's easy, you're not growing
- The "I have no idea what I'm doing" feeling is normal
- Even 10-year veterans feel this learning new tech

**Example:** Remember how confused you were by props on Day 1? Now they're obvious. Everything becomes obvious eventually.

### Build Things
> Theory without practice fades. Build constantly.

- Reading about code ≠ writing code
- Tutorial hell is real—build without guides
- Break things on purpose to learn boundaries
- Shipping > perfection

**Example:** You'll learn more building 3 imperfect projects than reading 10 perfect tutorials.

### Share Knowledge
> Teaching others solidifies your own understanding.

- Write blog posts about what you learn
- Answer questions on Reddit/StackOverflow
- Help beginners on Discord
- Explain concepts to non-programmers

**Example:** Try explaining useState to a friend. You'll discover gaps in your own understanding.

### Be Patient
> Expertise takes years. Enjoy the journey.

- Don't compare your Day 30 to someone's Year 5
- Celebrate small wins
- Progress isn't linear
- Consistency beats intensity

**Example:** 1 hour/day for a year > 10 hours/week for a month then quitting.

### Value Fundamentals
> Frameworks change. Principles don't.

- Learn JavaScript deeply, not just React
- Understand HTTP, not just fetch
- Know CSS, not just Tailwind
- Study data structures, not just libraries

**Example:** React will eventually be replaced. Knowing "how UIs update" will transfer to any framework.

### Seek Feedback Early
> Code reviews make you better faster.

- Share code publicly (GitHub)
- Ask for reviews (Reddit, Discord)
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Give feedback to others

**Example:** Post your project on r/webdev with "feedback wanted" flair. You'll learn what you missed.

### Embrace Failure
> Every bug is a lesson. Every error is progress.

- Errors are teachers, not enemies
- "Broke it" means "learned a boundary"
- Failed projects teach more than successful ones
- Read your error messages—they're helpful!

**Example:** The bug that took you 2 hours to fix? You'll never make that mistake again.

## Final Thoughts

You've done something most people only talk about: you learned to code and built something real.

The path forward is more of the same:
- Find problems
- Build solutions
- Learn from mistakes
- Share with others

**Remember:**
- You don't need to know everything
- You don't need permission to build
- You don't need perfect code
- You just need to keep building

**The secret to becoming a great developer:**
> Build things. Every day. For years. That's it.
