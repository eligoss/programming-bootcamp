# What's Next

> **Time**: ~5 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

## What You'll Learn

- Where to go from here
- Resources for continued learning
- Suggested next projects

## The Big Idea

This bootcamp was a foundation, not a ceiling. Here's how to keep building.

## Immediate Next Steps

### Today/Tomorrow

1. **Share your work**
   - Post your project URL
   - Update LinkedIn
   - Tell someone what you built

2. **Review the code**
   - Read through what was generated
   - Make sure you understand each part
   - Add comments where helpful

3. **Make one small addition**
   - A minor feature
   - A styling improvement
   - Just to prove you can

### This Week

1. **Practice the workflow**
   - Build something small from scratch
   - Follow the same Plan → Implement → Verify → Commit loop
   - Don't use this guide — try on your own

2. **Explore the codebase**
   - What happens if you change X?
   - Can you add a new route?
   - Try breaking things (on a branch!)

## The Developer Mindset

As you continue:

### Stay Curious
> "How does this work?" is the best question.

### Embrace Confusion
> Confusion precedes understanding. Every time.

### Build Things
> Theory without practice fades. Build constantly.

### Share Knowledge
> Teaching others solidifies your own understanding.

### Be Patient
> Expertise takes years. Enjoy the journey.

## Final Thoughts

You've done something most people only talk about: you learned to code and built something real.

The path forward is more of the same:
- Find problems
- Build solutions
- Learn from mistakes
- Share with others

Welcome to the world of developers.
