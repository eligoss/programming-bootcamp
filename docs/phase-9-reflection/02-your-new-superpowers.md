# Your New Superpowers

> **Time**: ~5 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

## What You'll Learn

- Recognition of skills acquired
- How to articulate what you can do
- Confidence in your abilities

## The Big Idea

You started today as a complete beginner. Now you have real skills. Let's name them.

## Technical Skills Acquired

### Environment & Tools

| Skill | What You Can Now Do |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Terminal** | Navigate folders, run commands |
| **VS Code** | Edit code, use extensions |
| **Git** | Track changes, commit, push |
| **GitHub** | Store code, collaborate |
| **npm** | Install packages, run scripts |

### Web Development

| Skill | What You Can Now Do |
|-------|---------------------|
| **React** | Build component-based UIs |
| **TypeScript** | Write type-safe JavaScript |
| **Routing** | Create multi-page apps |
| **State** | Manage data that changes |
| **Forms** | Handle user input |

### Backend & Data

| Skill | What You Can Now Do |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Firebase Auth** | Implement user authentication |
| **Firestore** | Store and retrieve data |
| **Security Rules** | Protect data access |
| **Deployment** | Put apps on the internet |

### Development Process

| Skill | What You Can Now Do |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Requirements** | Define what to build |
| **Work Breakdown** | Split big tasks into small ones |
| **AI Collaboration** | Work effectively with Claude |
| **Debugging** | Find and fix problems |
| **Code Review** | Evaluate code quality |

## What This Means

### You Can Build Things

You went from "never written code" to "deployed web application."

That's not a small thing. Most people who say they want to learn programming never build anything real. You did.

### You Can Learn More

The specific technologies matter less than the meta-skill:
> "I can learn a new technology and build something with it."

React today. Vue tomorrow. Swift next year. The pattern is the same.

### You Can Work with AI

You learned the AI development loop:
> Plan → Implement → Verify → Commit

This skill multiplies everything else. AI doesn't replace developers — it makes effective developers faster.

### You Can Solve Problems

You encountered errors, understood them, and fixed them. That's the core developer skill.

## Skills to Put on Your Resume

You can honestly say:

```
Technical Skills:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
- Git/GitHub
- CI/CD basics

Projects:
- Built and deployed a full-stack web application with user
  authentication and data persistence using React, TypeScript,
  and Firebase
```

## The Confidence Shift

**Before today:**
> "I could never be a programmer."

**After today:**
> "I built something. I can build more."

This shift is more valuable than any single technical skill.

## What You're Capable of Now

Given a few hours and Claude's help, you could:

- [ ] Build another CRUD app (different domain)
- [ ] Add new features to this app
- [ ] Learn a new React library
- [ ] Deploy a different project
- [ ] Help someone else get started

## Check Your Understanding

- [ ] I can list my new technical skills
- [ ] I understand the value of the process I learned
- [ ] I feel confident I can continue learning
- [ ] I know what to put on my resume
