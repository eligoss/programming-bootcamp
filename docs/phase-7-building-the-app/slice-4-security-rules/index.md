# Slice 4: Security Rules

> **Time**: ~15 minutes | **Goal**: Proper database protection

## What We're Building

Security rules are the gatekeeper of your data. They define:
- Who can read what
- Who can write what
- What data is valid

Without rules, anyone could access your database.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Security rules written
- [ ] Rules deployed to Firebase
- [ ] Tested that protection works
- [ ] Understanding of rule structure
