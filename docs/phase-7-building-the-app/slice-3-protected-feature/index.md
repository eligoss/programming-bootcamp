# Slice 3: Protected Feature

> **Time**: ~25 minutes | **Goal**: Your core feature with CRUD operations

## What We're Building

This is YOUR feature — notes, tasks, bookmarks, or posts. We'll build:
- Create new items
- View your items
- Edit existing items
- Delete items

All protected by authentication and scoped to your user.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Firestore database set up
- [ ] Create functionality
- [ ] Read/list functionality
- [ ] Update functionality
- [ ] Delete functionality
- [ ] Data scoped to current user
