# Slice 1: App Skeleton

> **Time**: ~15 minutes | **Goal**: Basic app structure with navigation

## What We're Building

The skeleton is the bones of your app:
- Page structure
- Navigation
- Routes

No real functionality yet — just the structure everything else will build on.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Home page (public)
- [ ] Login page (public)
- [ ] Register page (public)
- [ ] Dashboard page (will be protected later)
- [ ] Navigation component
- [ ] Working links between pages

## Contents

1. [Goals](./goals) — What exactly we're building
2. [Prompts](./prompts) — Example prompts for Claude

## The Approach

```
1. Set up routing
2. Create page shells
3. Create navigation
4. Connect everything
5. Verify and commit
```
