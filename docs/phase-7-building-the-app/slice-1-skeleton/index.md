# Slice 1: App Skeleton

> **Time**: ~40 minutes | **Goal**: Basic app structure with navigation

## What We're Building

The skeleton is the bones of your app:
- Page structure with React Router
- Navigation between pages
- Layout component for consistent structure
- Basic professional styling

No real functionality yet — just the structure everything else will build on.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] React Router set up with four routes
- [ ] Home, Login, Register, and Dashboard pages
- [ ] Navigation component with working links
- [ ] Layout component using children prop
- [ ] Clean, professional styling
- [ ] Deep understanding of how it all works

## Learning Approach

This slice is broken into **small, interactive steps**. Each step:
1. **Explains concepts first** — Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Prompts you to ask AI questions** — Active learning, not passive copying
3. **Builds one small thing** — Never more than 8 minutes per step
4. **Verifies it works** — Catch problems immediately
5. **Ensures understanding** — Ask AI to explain what it built

## How to Use This Slice

### Start Here
If this is your first time building a React app, **start with the concepts**:

[Read Core Concepts First →](./concepts)

### Then Follow the Steps
Work through each step **in order**. Don't skip steps — each builds on the previous one:

[Begin Step 1: Understanding Routing →](./steps/01-understanding-routing)

### Use Active Learning
At each step:
- ✅ Read the "Ask AI" prompts and actually ask them
- ✅ Wait for AI to explain before writing code
- ✅ Ask follow-up questions if anything is unclear
- ✅ Ask AI to explain the code it generates
- ✅ Verify your work before moving on

### Don't Just Copy
The goal is **understanding**, not speed. You should be able to explain:
- What each component does
- Why we use certain patterns
- How the pieces fit together

### Final Check
