# Slice 2: Authentication

> **Time**: ~25 minutes | **Goal**: Working user registration, login, and logout

## What We're Building

This is the core security of your app:
- User registration with email/password
- User login
- Logout functionality
- Protected routes

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Firebase configured
- [ ] Registration form that creates accounts
- [ ] Login form that signs users in
- [ ] Logout button that signs users out
- [ ] Auth state tracked across the app
- [ ] Dashboard protected (redirects if not logged in)

## Prerequisites

Before starting:
- [ ] Firebase project created (we'll do this together)
- [ ] Slice 1 complete (app skeleton works)
