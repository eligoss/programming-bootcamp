# Phase 7: Building the App

> **Time**: ~90 minutes | **Goal**: Build your application slice by slice

## What This Phase Is About

This is where it all comes together. You'll build your application in **vertical slices** — complete features from top to bottom, one at a time.

Each slice produces something that works. You'll never be more than 20 minutes from a working state.

## What You'll Learn

- **Vertical slices** — Thin, end-to-end features
- **Incremental building** — Small steps, frequent commits
- **AI collaboration in practice** — Real prompts, real code

## The Slices

| Slice | What You Build | Time |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **1: Skeleton** | Basic app structure, routing | ~15 min |
| **2: Authentication** | User registration and login | ~25 min |
| **3: Protected Feature** | Your main feature (notes, tasks, etc.) | ~25 min |
| **4: Security Rules** | Database protection | ~15 min |
| **5: Polish** | Error handling, loading states | ~10 min |

## The Approach

For each slice:
1. **Read the goals** — Understand what "done" looks like
2. **Use the prompts** — Start with provided examples
3. **Verify each step** — Run the app frequently
4. **Commit when working** — Small, meaningful commits

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] A complete, working web application
- [ ] User authentication implemented
- [ ] Your protected feature functional
- [ ] Security rules in place
- [ ] Clean, polished UI
