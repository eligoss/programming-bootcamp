# Phase 4: Choosing Your Stack

> **Time**: ~20 minutes | **Goal**: Decide which tools to use and why

## What This Phase Is About

Every web application needs technology choices:
- What language to write in?
- What framework to use?
- Where to store data?
- How to handle users?

This phase teaches you *how* to think about these decisions, not just *what* to pick.

## What You'll Learn

- **Decision framework** — How to evaluate options
- **Frontend landscape** — React, Vue, plain JavaScript
- **Backend landscape** — Firebase vs building your own
- **TypeScript** — Why types help beginners
- **Our stack decision** — What we'll use and why

## The Key Insight

> There's no "best" technology. There's only "best for this situation."

Different projects need different tools. We'll learn to evaluate tradeoffs.

## Spoiler: Our Stack

We'll end up choosing:
- **TypeScript** — JavaScript with guardrails
- **React** — Most popular UI framework
- **Firebase** — Authentication and database without a server

But the *process* of deciding is as important as the decision.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] A framework for evaluating technology
- [ ] Understanding of why React + Firebase fits this project
- [ ] Your first ADR (Architecture Decision Record)
