# Phase 5: Project Setup

> **Time**: ~30 minutes | **Goal**: Initialize a professional-grade project

## What This Phase Is About

Starting a project well saves hours of pain later. Professional projects have:
- Version control from day one
- Code quality tools that catch mistakes
- Automation that verifies things work
- Documentation that helps AI help you

This phase sets all of that up.

## What You'll Learn

- **GitHub basics** — Creating and managing repositories
- **Project structure** — Folders, files, conventions
- **Code quality tools** — ESLint and Prettier
- **Branch protection** — Guardrails that protect you
- **GitHub Actions** — Automation that checks your work
- **CLAUDE.md** — Teaching AI about your project

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] A GitHub repository for your project
- [ ] A React + TypeScript project initialized
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configured
- [ ] Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [ ] A CLAUDE.md file ready for AI collaboration
