## What We're Building Today

| You'll Build | Using |
|--------------|-------|
| User registration & login | Firebase Auth |
| Your own private feature | React + Firestore |
| Deployed to a live URL | Firebase Hosting |

**End result:** A real web app you can show anyone, running on the internet.

## Pick Your Feature

You'll build authentication **plus one of these** — your choice:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Notes** | Create, edit, delete private notes |
| **Tasks** | A todo list with checkboxes |
| **Bookmarks** | Save and organize links |

All three are similar complexity. Pick what sounds most useful to you.

**Your choice:** ________________

## Ground Rules

**You drive.** You type the code, make decisions, and ask questions. I navigate and keep us on track.

**AI helps, but you understand.** Claude Code generates code; you make sure you know what it does before using it.

**Working beats perfect.** We're shipping something real, not polishing forever.

**Questions are good.** If something doesn't make sense, stop me.

## Quick Vibe Check

Before we dive in:
- Any previous experience with React, TypeScript, or Firebase? (It's fine if not)
- Anything specific you want to make sure we cover?
- Any time constraints I should know about?
