::: tip Good Morning, **RASANDE**! 🌅
I hope you slept well! Today we have a lot to cover, but don't worry — I've built this guide to be your backbone throughout our session. You can start reading through it while you're commuting, and we'll work through everything together step by step. Ready for an exciting day of learning?
:::

# Welcome to the Programming Bootcamp

This guide is designed for **complete beginners** — no prior programming experience required.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this bootcamp, you'll have created and deployed a real web application with:

- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ A private dashboard only you can see
- ✅ A useful feature (notes, tasks, bookmarks — you decide!)
- ✅ Deployed live on the internet

## What You'll Learn

| Phase | What You'll Master |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Foundations** | How the web works, your development tools |
| **Requirements** | How to think about what you're building |
| **Stack Selection** | How to choose the right tools |
| **Project Setup** | Professional-grade project structure |
| **Working with AI** | Using Claude Code effectively |
| **Building** | Actually writing the application |
| **Deployment** | Getting it live on the internet |

## How This Guide Works

This guide is structured as a **4-5 hour mentored session**. Each phase builds on the previous one.

::: tip Navigation
Use the sidebar to navigate between phases. Each phase has an overview page that explains what you'll learn and how long it takes.
