# Phase 6: Working with AI

> **Time**: ~25 minutes | **Goal**: Learn to collaborate effectively with Claude Code

## What This Phase Is About

AI is changing how developers work. Claude Code can be an incredibly powerful partner — but only if you know how to work with it effectively.

This phase teaches you the skills that separate people who get frustrated with AI from people who become 10x more productive.

## What You'll Learn

- **Mental model** — AI as pair programmer, not magic button
- **Prompt anatomy** — Structure, context, and examples
- **The development loop** — Plan → Implement → Verify → Commit
- **Reviewing AI code** — What to check, red flags to spot
- **Debugging together** — How to describe problems
- **Safety rules** — What to never share with AI
- **Getting unstuck** — When to research yourself

## The Key Insight

> AI doesn't replace understanding. It amplifies it.

The more you understand, the better prompts you write, the better code you get.

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] A clear mental model of AI collaboration
- [ ] The core development loop memorized
- [ ] Practice writing effective prompts
- [ ] Understanding of what to verify
