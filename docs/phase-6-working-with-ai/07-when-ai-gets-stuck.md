# When AI Gets Stuck

> **Time**: ~3 minutes | **Difficulty**: Beginner

## What You'll Learn

- Signs that AI might be wrong
- How to verify AI suggestions
- When and how to research yourself

## The Big Idea

AI is knowledgeable but not perfect. Sometimes it:
- Uses outdated information
- Confidently gives wrong answers
- Doesn't know about recent updates

Knowing when to verify and how to research yourself is a superpower.

## Signs AI Might Be Wrong

### 🤔 It contradicts itself

Previous answer says X, now it says not-X.

### 🤔 The suggestion doesn't compile

If the code has syntax errors, something's off.

### 🤔 It sounds unsure

"I think this might work..." or "You could try..."

### 🤔 It keeps changing approach

If you've gone through 3+ different solutions without success.

### 🤔 The documentation says otherwise

When official docs contradict AI.

## How to Verify AI Suggestions

### 1. Check Official Documentation

For React: [react.dev](https://react.dev)
For Firebase: [firebase.google.com/docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs)
For TypeScript: [typescriptlang.org/docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

### 2. Run the Code

The ultimate test. Does it work?

### 3. Ask a Different Way

Rephrase your question:
```
"I asked about X earlier and got Y answer. Can you explain
a different approach to X? I want to compare options."
```

### 4. Check Stack Overflow

Search for your specific error message.

### 5. Ask Your Mentor

Human judgment for complex issues.

## Research Skills

When you need to research yourself:

### Effective Search Queries

**Bad:** "react not working"

**Good:** "react useEffect runs twice strict mode"

**Pattern:** [Technology] + [Specific Error or Behavior]

### Reading Documentation

1. **Start with the overview** — Understand the concept
2. **Find examples** — Copy and adapt
3. **Check API reference** — For exact syntax
4. **Look for common mistakes** — Often listed

### Reading Stack Overflow

1. **Read the question** — Is it your exact problem?
2. **Read the top answer** — Check the votes
3. **Read the comments** — Often have important updates
4. **Check the date** — Old answers might be outdated

## The Three-Strike Rule

If AI gives you three solutions that don't work:

1. **Stop and reassess** — Maybe the question is wrong
2. **Check documentation** — Verify the basics
3. **Simplify the problem** — Remove complexity
4. **Ask for help** — Mentor or community

## Building Research Muscle

Over time, develop the habit:

```
AI answer → Works? → Great!
           ↓
       Doesn't work
           ↓
   Try once more with more context
           ↓
       Still doesn't work?
           ↓
   Official docs + Stack Overflow
           ↓
       Still stuck?
           ↓
   Ask mentor or take a break
```
