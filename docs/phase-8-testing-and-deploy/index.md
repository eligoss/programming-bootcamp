# Phase 8: Testing & Deploy

> **Time**: ~25 minutes | **Goal**: Verify everything works and ship it

## What This Phase Is About

You've built something real. Now it's time to:
1. Make sure it actually works
2. Put it on the internet where anyone can use it

This is the most satisfying part — seeing your creation live.

## What You'll Learn

- **Testing basics** — What to test, how to test
- **Deployment** — Firebase Hosting step-by-step
- **Demo preparation** — Making a good impression

## By the End

You'll have:
- [ ] Verified all features work
- [ ] Deployed to a live URL
- [ ] A demo-ready application

## The Deployment Reality

Deploying used to be hard. With Firebase Hosting, it's:

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

Two commands. That's it.
